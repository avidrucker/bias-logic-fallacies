Just as an actual man made of straw is a less solid version of a man made of flesh, a straw man argument is a less solid version of a fully fleshed out argument. A straw man replaces or represents whatever actual argument is being made. Straw manning can come in many different forms. It's not even always intentional. You might accidentally construct a straw man if you don't fully understand the depth of an argument. And that is fine. It happens to the best of us. However, to intentionally misread or misrepresent an argument to simplify the process of discrediting it, that's a little bit less forgivable. To take nuanced points out of context, to ignore crucial information, to even exaggerate claims to the point of absurdity which is then easier to refute, these are all straw man tactics. For example, Mike and Straw Mike are having a conversation about how to responsibly depict awful stuff in media. I don't think it's too much to ask that when a media creator wants to show heinous or awful stuff, they do so in a context that shows that that stuff is heinous and awful. Oh, so now we're not allowed to show violent or terrible things unless we include some long-winded sermon about how bad things are bad? I think creators should be able to show or do whatever they want. The original argument states a preference for what Mike thinks constitutes the responsible use of media. The straw man argument recasts this as something much simpler and easier to agree with-- freedom is good, censorship is bad. But now Mike and Straw Mike are no longer arguing about the same point and so the conversation will quickly become unfocused and aggressive, which is never fun. If you're going to win an argument, you want to win against what the other side actually thinks, don't you? A straw man argument keeps that from happening.

    "In 2006, Robert Talisse and Scott Aikin expanded the application and use of the **straw man fallacy** beyond that of previous rhetorical scholars, arguing that the straw man fallacy can take two forms: the original form that misrepresents the opponent's position, which they call the **representative form**; and a new form they call the **selection form**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The selection form focuses on a partial and weaker (and easier to refute) representation of the opponent's position. Then the easier refutation of this weaker position is claimed to refute the opponent's complete position. They point out the similarity of the selection form to the fallacy of hasty generalization, in which the refutation of an opposing position that is weaker than the opponent's is claimed as a refutation of all opposing arguments. Because they have found significantly increased use of the selection form in modern political argumentation, they view its identification as an important new tool for the improvement of public discourse.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aikin and Casey expanded on this model in 2010, introducing a third form. Referring to the \"**representative form**\" as the **classic straw man**, and the \"**selection form**\" as the **weak man**, a third form is called the **hollow man**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A hollow man argument is one that is a complete fabrication, where both the viewpoint and the opponent expressing it do not in fact exist, or at the very least the arguer has never encountered them. Such arguments frequently take the form of vague phrasing such as \"some say,\" \"someone out there thinks\" or similar weasel words, or it might attribute a non-existent argument to a broad movement in general, rather than an individual or organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "A variation on the selection form, or \"weak man\" argument, that combines with an ad hominem and fallacy of composition is nut picking, a neologism coined by Kevin Drum.
